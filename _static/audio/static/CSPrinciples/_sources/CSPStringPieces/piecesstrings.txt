Breaking Strings into Pieces
=============================

..	index::
	single: assignment
	single: split
	single: list
	pair: strings; assignment

**Learning Objectives:**:

- Using split to get at *parts* of a string.
- Use lists
- Use indices to get at parts of lists

Making MadLib Stories, Easier
===================================

You might recall this example from earlier in this section of the book.

.. activecode:: madlib1
   :tour_1: "Line by line tour"; 1: StExLine1; 2: StExLine2; 3: StEx-line3; 4: StExLine4; 5: StExLine5; 6: StEx-line6; 7: StEx-line7; 8: StExLine8; 9: StExLine9; 10: StExLine10; 11: StExLine11; 12: StExLine12; 13: StExLine13; 14: StExLine14; 15: StExLine15; 

   firstName = "Pat"
   lastName = "Smith"
   gender = "girl"
   address = "65 Elm Street"
   verb = "eat"
   start = "Once there was a " + gender + " named " + firstName + "."
   next1 = "A good " + gender + " living at " + address + "."
   next2 = "One day, a wicked witch came to the " + lastName + " house."
   next3 = "The wicked witch was planning to " + verb + " " + firstName + "!"
   ending = "But " + firstName + " was smart and avoided the wicked witch."
   print(start)
   print(next1)
   print(next2)
   print (next3)
   print(ending)

What if we want to change this story? We can change the values for ``firstName``, ``lastName``, ``gender``, ``address``, and ``verb``.  But, if we change each of these we are changing 5 lines.  Is there another way to do this?  What if we want to specify the values like this ``inputs="Pat,Smith,boy,65 Elm Street,eat"``?  Can we do that?

Sure, we can -- if we can take that string apart.  The computer knows how to break larger pieces of data into smaller ones.

Using the Split Function
===================================

The ``split`` function does exactly that.  It takes as input the character to split on, then returns a *list* with pieces.  The pieces can then be *indexed*.

Try running this program.

.. activecode:: firstsplit

   inputs = "Pat,Smith,girl,65 Elm Street,eat"
   pieces = inputs.split(",")
   print(pieces)
   print("First name is:")
   print(pieces[0])

.. mchoicemf:: question_firstsplit
   :answer_a: Smith
   :answer_b: girl
   :answer_c: 65 Elm Street
   :answer_d: eat
   :answer_e: We would get an error
   :correct: c
   :feedback_a: That's pieces[1].
   :feedback_b: That's pieces[2]
   :feedback_c: The address is at position 3 in the resulting list.
   :feedback_d: That's pieces[4]
   :feedback_e: Why would this cause an error?  We can use indices to get the element at an index in a list.

   What do you think we would get if we executed ``print(pieces[3])``

.. mchoicemf:: question_firstsplit2
   :answer_a: Smith
   :answer_b: girl
   :answer_c: 65 Elm Street
   :answer_d: eat
   :answer_e: We would get an error
   :correct: e
   :feedback_a: That's pieces[1].
   :feedback_b: That's pieces[2].
   :feedback_c: That's pieces[3].
   :feedback_d: That's pieces[4].
   :feedback_e: The error happens because that index is past the end of the list.  The last item is at index 4.

   What do you think we would get if we executed ``print(pieces[5])``
   
The code below is the first activecode modified to use the ``split`` function to assign the values to the variables.

.. activecode:: madlib1_split

   input = "Pat,Smith,girl,65 Elm Street,eat"
   pieces = input.split(",")
   firstName = pieces[0]
   lastName = pieces[1]
   gender = pieces[2]
   address = pieces[3]
   verb = pieces[4]
   start = "Once there was a " + gender + " named " + firstName + "."
   next1 = "A good " + gender + " living at " + address + "."
   next2 = "One day, a wicked witch came to the " + lastName + " house."
   next3 = "The wicked witch was planning to " + verb + " " + firstName + "!"
   ending = "But " + firstName + " was smart and avoided the wicked witch."
   print(start)
   print(next1)
   print(next2)
   print(next3)
   print(ending)

This makes it easy to change all of the data, by changing only one line.

.. activecode:: madlib1_split2

   input = "Abe,Brown,boy,1313 Maple Lane,trick"
   pieces = input.split(",")
   firstName = pieces[0]
   lastName = pieces[1]
   gender = pieces[2]
   address = pieces[3]
   verb = pieces[4]
   start = "Once there was a " + gender + " named " + firstName + "."
   next1 = "A good " + gender + " living at " + address + "."
   next2 = "One day, a wicked witch came to the " + lastName + " house."
   next3 = "The wicked witch was planning to " + verb + " " + firstName + "!"
   ending = "But " + firstName + " was smart and avoided the wicked witch."
   print(start)
   print(next1)
   print(next2)
   print(next3)
   print(ending)
